#Description
  * Madness is how Nero and by extension Babylon gain minions and control their minions. As the level of madness increases the toll it takes on the vessel worsens. If the vessel makes it to level 8 they are essentially a puppet of Nero (and by extension Babylon). Madness is acquired more easily on minds that have not rested or are nearing exhaustion/exhausted. Madness can also be inspired by practicing or siding with some fiends. The effects of Madness build upon each other.
  * Acquisition:
    - Cursed Items
    - Out of cover during heat wave - Constitution Saving Throw
    - Infected by Returner's slash, explosion, or scream
      - Explosion has the greatest chance to affect Madness Level - Wisdom Saving Throw
      - Scream has a moderate affect on Madness Levels - Constitution Saving Throw
      - Slash has least affect on Madness - Constitution Saving Throw
    - Cursed by members of the Church of Morning's Wake
    - Spend too much time on tainted land without proper protection
    - Too many days without rest
